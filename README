Mobi to Readmill Service
========================

Is a webservice that will take your (non drm) mobi files, convert them into
epubs and send them to your Readmill account.

Currently it performs no special formatting on the content of the files
and may be a bit basic, but fortunately .mobi files themselves are usually
very simple and convert okay.

It was built over several hours as part of the UIKode 2013 [1] hackday.

Installation
------------

First you'll need python with pip and virtualenv (or virtualenvwrapper)
installed on your system. To install a local virtual environment run:

    $ virtualenv env --distribute
    $ source env/bin/activate

Then to install the project dependancies:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Finally to run the app locally:

    $ python server.py

There is also a `Procfile` provided for running the app on Heroku [1] this
can be run using Foreman [2] or Honcho [3].

Configuration
-------------

The default settings are available in the `settings.py` file. These can
be overridden by creating a local `local_settings.py`:

    $ touch local_settings.py

To this you can then add whatever overrides you wish. The two required
settings are:

 - `READMILL_CLIENT_ID`: Your unique app id.
 - `READMILL_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your unique app secret.

These can both be found under the "your apps" section of the site [1].

for making external http requests.
